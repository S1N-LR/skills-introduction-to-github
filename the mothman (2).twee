:: \ grab a rock throw it {"position":"3200,675","size":"100,100"}
as you throw the rock at the creature, the creature turns its red piercing eyes are on you and begins chasing you with its large dark wings, while releasing a terrifying screech.

[[distract it]]


:: Call the park ranger and wait it out {"position":"2300,1000","size":"100,100"}
When the park rangers arrived you and Mike told them what had happen, and they quickly began searching for Sarah, but found nothing. Apparently many people camping by themselves at that park were going missing, authorities believed that the campers would go to the park to isolate themselves from the world and commit s######. 

They believed this because months later they would find human bones belonging to missing campers. 

Its been 3 months since, Sarah went missing, and 2 months since Mike went looking for her. 

Everything went silent and you lost both your close friends.
